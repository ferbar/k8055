# k8055 for libusb-1.0

This library acts as a driver for the Velleman K8055 USB Experiment Board for operating systems supporting libusb-1.0, such as Linux. While providing a high-
level interface for the user, the library communicates with a k8055 board through libusb.

## Requirements
-libusb-1.0 (see src/Makefile to set include path)
-(doxygen for documentation generation)

## Build
Run ```make''' in the project root folder. Products are copied to `target' directory.

## Documentation
See the comments in the source code for documentation about usage. Note: the API isn't the same as the one provided by Velleman in their DLL but enables the same features.

Run ```make doc''' to generate doxygen documentation.

## Authors
The library is written by Jakob Odersky. Nevertheless, it is based on the information provided by the following people who wrote the original version of `libk8055' (http://libk8055.sourceforge.net/):
